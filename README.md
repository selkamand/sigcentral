Understanding Scars in the Cancer Multiome

## Philosophy
Processes that create cancer leave scars on the genome, transcriptome, and methylome. SigCentral consolidates knowledge about the impact of tumorigenic processes across the multiome. Additionally, it provides links to tools that can help you identify these scars in your own tumor samples.
