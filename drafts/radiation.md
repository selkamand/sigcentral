# Radiation

## Background

Cancer patients are exposed to ionizing radiation at several times throughout their cancer journey.

1. **Diagnostic Radiography**: Used in imaging scans to help diagnose and monitor tumours
2. **Radiotherapy**: Tumours are exposed to high energy X-rays (usually photon beams) to kill (or prevent division) of tumour cells


## Genomic Scars

There are several scars left by radiation exposure, which has been uncovered using a mix of experimental models and also studying differences between radiation naiive and radiation exposed patient tumours.

Behjati et al, 2016, by studying 12 radiation associated second malignancies of different types (osteosarcoma, spindle cell sarcoma, angeosarcoma and breast cancer) and identified a couple of tumor-type independent radiation-associated mutational signatures

1. High Number of Indels (Indel/SBS ratio)
2. High Number of short Dels (1-100bp) often with microhomology at the junction (Del / Indel ration)
3. Deletions showed no variation in density across the genome and did not correlate with sequence context, replication timing, or chromatin structure. This is highly atypical. Most mutagenic signatures are strongly affected by chromatin organisation - can't mutate DNA you don't have access to. Since radiation can access even heterochromatin, this finding is not surprising.
4. Balanced Inversions, a rare type of rearrangement, was in 92% (11/12) radiation-associated tumours but only 15% of radiation na√Øve tumours.

## Links to other aetiologies

Several radiation-associated genomic scars resemble those induced by non-homologus end-join repair. So much so that it strongly suggests that what we're seeing is the result of NHEJ repair of the radiation induced damage. This also makes radiation associated scars quite similar to HRd signatures (since NHEJ gets upregulated as the fallback when HR is knocked out). This raises the question: why does radiation-induced damage seem to be preferentially repaired by NHEJ instead of the much better HR pathway?

Also - in regards to separating radiation from other HR signatures: In theory, the lack of topographic biases should be radiation specific.
